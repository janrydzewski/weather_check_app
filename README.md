# Weather Check

This is a mobile application available on Android and iOS that displays the current weather and date in a specific location worldwide. Users have the option to view the weather in their current location or search for a new one. In case of providing an incorrect location name, the user is notified of the error. For each weather report, the user can see humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. Additionally, at the bottom of the screen, there is a slider that allows the user to view the weather for the current day and the next.

The application has been built with:

<li>bloc</li>
<li>equatable
<li>dio</li>
<li>geocoding</li>
